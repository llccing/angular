### Questions: what is bazel, i see some files in angular repo with the bazel sufix

Answer from Gemini-2.0-flash: 

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It excels at building large-scale software projects that span multiple repositories and deployments.  It's particularly well-suited for monolithic repositories (monorepos) and complex builds.

Here's a breakdown of why you see Bazel in an Angular repository and its key benefits:

**Why Angular Uses Bazel:**

* **Scalability:** Angular is a large project, and Bazel helps them manage its build complexity and ensure scalability as the project grows.  It handles building the framework itself, the CLI, and related tooling efficiently.
* **Reproducibility:** Bazel guarantees reproducible builds.  Given the same input files and build configuration, Bazel will always produce the same output, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.  This is crucial for a framework that is used across countless different development environments.
* **Incremental Builds:** Bazel understands the dependency graph of your project. It only rebuilds or retests what's changed since the last build. This results in significantly faster build times, especially for large projects.
* **Consistency and Reliability:** Bazel promotes consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).  It uses a hermetic build environment, meaning the build process is isolated from the host system's dependencies.  This ensures that builds are reliable and predictable regardless of the developer's machine.
* **Test Execution and Results:**  Bazel provides robust testing infrastructure.  It can run tests consistently and efficiently, and it provides clear results and reporting.  This ensures the quality of the Angular framework itself.
* **Caching and Sharing of Build Artifacts:**  Bazel can cache build artifacts locally and remotely. This allows developers to share build results, further speeding up the development process.  If someone has already built a specific module, you can reuse their build instead of rebuilding it yourself.

**Bazel Files in an Angular Repository:**

You'll likely find files named `BUILD` (or `BUILD.bazel`) and potentially `WORKSPACE` in the Angular repository. These files are central to Bazel's operation:

* **`WORKSPACE`:**  This file identifies the root of the Bazel workspace (the project).  It can also contain declarations of external dependencies, like npm packages or other libraries. Basically, it defines the boundaries of the project and tells Bazel where to find external requirements.
* **`BUILD` (or `BUILD.bazel`)**: These files define *targets*. Targets are buildable unitsâ€”libraries, binaries, tests, etc. Each `BUILD` file describes how to build its targets, declaring inputs (source files), dependencies on other targets, and the toolchain to use (compiler, linker, etc.).  Think of these as analogous to `pom.xml` in Maven or `build.gradle` in Gradle, but focused on describing the *build targets* and their dependencies.

**In summary:**

Bazel is a powerful build system that Angular uses to manage its own development and release process. It brings benefits like scalability, reproducibility, and faster build times, all crucial for a large and widely used framework. The `BUILD` and `WORKSPACE` files tell Bazel *what* to build and *how* to build it. You likely won't need to directly interact with these files when *using* Angular in your own projects (unless you're contributing to Angular itself or need to customize certain build aspects using  Angular CLI's Bazel experimental features), but recognizing their presence helps you understand how Angular itself is developed and maintained.


### what is the language of it, how angular use it

Answer from Gemini-2.0-flash:

**Language of Bazel:**

Bazel uses a declarative, domain-specific language (DSL) called **Starlark** (formerly known as Skylark) for its build definition files (i.e., the `BUILD` files).

*   **Declarative:** Instead of writing imperative code that describes *how* to perform each step of the build process, you declare *what* needs to be built and the dependencies between the build components. Bazel then figures out the optimal way to execute the build.
*   **Starlark:** Starlark is a limited subset of Python. It's designed to be simpler and more deterministic than full Python, making it suitable for defining build rules. It omits features that would make builds non-reproducible or unsafe, such as arbitrary I/O or the ability to access the network during the build process.

**Why Starlark?**

*   **Safety:** Starlark is sandboxed.  It cannot access the network, the file system in an unrestricted way, or run arbitrary shell commands. This is crucial for guaranteeing build reproducibility and preventing malicious build scripts.
*   **Determinism:** Starlark lacks features that could make builds non-deterministic, such as mutable global state or uncontrolled random number generation. This ensures that a given set of inputs and build rules always produces the same output.
*   **Simplicity:** Starlark is a relatively small language, making it easier to learn and use than full-fledged programming languages like Python or Java.

**How Angular Uses Bazel/Starlark:**

1.  **Defining Build Targets:** Angular uses `BUILD` files (written in Starlark) to define various build targets, such as:

    *   Libraries: Individual Angular modules (e.g., `@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/router`).  These are packaged as reusable code.
    *   Binaries: Executable programs, like the Angular CLI (`@angular/cli`).
    *   Tests: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for Angular components and services.
    *   Documentation: Building the Angular documentation website.
    *   Packages: Creating distributable npm packages for publishing to npm.

2.  **Describing Dependencies:**  The `BUILD` files also declare the dependencies between the different build targets. For example:

    *   `@angular/common` might depend on `@angular/core`.
    *   The Angular CLI depends on several Angular libraries.
    *   Tests depend on the code they are testing.

3.  **Using Build Rules:** Angular makes use of pre-defined Bazel build rules (and may define its own custom rules) to specify *how* to build each target.  These rules encapsulate the low-level details of compiling TypeScript code, packaging JavaScript bundles, running tests, etc.

    *   **Example Build Rules:**
        *   `ts_library`:  For compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript libraries.
        *   `ng_module`: Specialized build rule for Angular modules, likely handling tasks like AOT compilation and metadata generation.
        *   `nodejs_binary`: To package up the Angular CLI as a Node.js executable.
        *   `npm_package`: Used to create npm publishable packages from the build outputs.
    *    These rules tell Bazel *how* to perform the compilation, bundling, minification, and other steps needed to produce the final artifacts.

4.  **Build and Test Execution:** When you run a Bazel command (e.g., `bazel build //...` to build everything or `bazel test //...` to run all tests), Bazel reads the `BUILD` files, analyzes the dependency graph, and then executes the build rules in the correct order to build the specified targets.

**Example (Conceptual) `BUILD` file snippet for an Angular Component:**

```python
# Example is simplified for illustration purposes.  Real BUILD files are more complex.

load("@npm//:rules_nodejs.bzl", "ts_project")  # Load rule for Typescript projects

ts_project(
    name = "my_component",
    srcs = glob(["*.ts"]),  # Include all .ts files in this folder
    deps = [
        "@npm//:rxjs",         # Declare dependency on RxJS
        "@npm//:@angular/core",   # Declare dependency on Angular core
    ],
    declaration = True,       # Generate declaration files (.d.ts)
    module_name = "my-component",  #ESM module name
    out_dir="dist/my-component"
    # Other options like tsconfig.json path, etc.
)

```

**Explanation of the Example:**

*   `load("@npm//:rules_nodejs.bzl", "ts_project")`:  Loads the `ts_project` rule from the `rules_nodejs` library, which extends Bazel with features relating to Node.js and TypeScript.
*   `ts_project(...)`: Defines a build target named "my\_component".
    *   `srcs = glob(["\*.ts"])`: Specifies that all `.ts` files in the current directory are source files for this component.
    *   `deps = [...]`: Declares dependencies on npm packages like RxJS and Angular Core. This tells Bazel that these dependencies must be built *before* building `my_component`.
    *   `declaration = True`: Tell the command to create `d.ts` files during build.

**In a nutshell:** Angular uses Starlark, through the syntax of the `BUILD` files, to declare how its source code should be built into distributable artifacts. Starlark provides the structure and syntax for defining targets, specifying dependencies, and invoking build rules. Bazel then uses this information to perform the actual build process in an efficient and reproducible way. Although you won't usually need to write Starlark when simply using the Angular framework or CLI, being aware of its role gives insight into how Angular manages its internal builds and releases.
